# Investment Wizard app
## Proposal

As a retail investor, I want a simple interface to enter a stock symbol and see its:

* full stock name
* current price
* _percent_ up or down for the day
* _value_ up or down for the day
* a related recent news item

The most recent stock symbol will be saved locally and automatically populate when the page is refreshed.
