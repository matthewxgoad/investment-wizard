# Investment Wizard app
## Proposal

As a retail investor, I want to maintain a list of stocks that I'm interested in and see financial information and news to make better investment decisions.

The user will see information such as:

* full stock name
* current price
* _percent_ up or down for the day
* _value_ up or down for the day
* a related recent news item
